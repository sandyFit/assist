# Medical AI Assistant Compliance Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the compliance and safety guidelines for the Medical AI Assistant application. The system is designed to augment healthcare professionals' capabilities while maintaining strict adherence to medical ethics, data privacy regulations, and patient safety standards.

## Core Principles

1. **Human Oversight**: All AI-generated suggestions must be reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals before being presented to patients.

2. **Safety First**: The system includes multiple safety checks, including content filtering, priority scoring, and escalation protocols for potentially harmful or urgent medical situations.

3. **Privacy Compliance**: All patient data is handled in accordance with relevant healthcare privacy regulations.

4. **Transparency**: The system clearly indicates when content is AI-generated versus doctor-reviewed, ensuring users understand the source of information.

## AI Integration Guidelines

### Permitted Uses

- Generating initial responses to patient queries based on provided information
- Analyzing uploaded medical documents for relevant information extraction
- Prioritizing queries based on urgency and safety concerns
- Suggesting potential diagnoses and treatments for doctor review

### Prohibited Uses

- Providing final medical advice directly to patients without doctor review
- Making definitive diagnoses without human verification
- Prescribing medications or treatments autonomously
- Handling emergency medical situations without immediate escalation

## Safety Protocols

### Query Triage System

All incoming patient queries are automatically assessed for:

1. **Priority Level**: Categorized as Urgent, High, Medium, or Low based on medical keywords and context
2. **Safety Score**: A numerical assessment (0.0-1.0) of potential safety concerns
3. **Escalation Threshold**: Queries exceeding safety thresholds are flagged for immediate review

### Content Moderation

AI-generated suggestions undergo multiple checks:

1. **Medical Accuracy**: Verification against established medical knowledge
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Assessment of the AI's certainty in its suggestions
3. **Harmful Content Filtering**: Removal of potentially dangerous or inappropriate content

## Doctor Review Process

1. Doctors review AI-generated suggestions through a dedicated interface
2. They can approve, modify, or reject suggestions with explanatory notes
3. Only doctor-approved content is released to patients
4. All reviews are logged for quality assurance and improvement

## Data Handling

### Patient Data

- All patient identifiable information must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access to patient data is restricted to authorized personnel only
- Data retention policies comply with relevant healthcare regulations

### Document Processing

- Uploaded medical documents are stored securely
- File validation ensures only permitted file types are accepted
- Document analysis is performed in a secure environment

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Feedback Loop**: Doctor reviews and corrections are used to improve AI suggestions
2. **Regular Audits**: System performance and safety are regularly evaluated
3. **Model Updates**: AI models are updated based on the latest medical knowledge and feedback

## Emergency Protocols

For queries identified as potential emergencies:

1. The system prominently displays emergency service contact information
2. Urgent queries are prioritized in the doctor review queue
3. Automated notifications are sent to on-call medical staff

## Disclaimer

This Medical AI Assistant is designed as a tool to augment healthcare professionals' capabilities, not replace them. It is intended for demonstration purposes in a hackathon environment and would require additional compliance measures before deployment in a real clinical setting.
